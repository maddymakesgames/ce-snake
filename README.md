# CE-Snake

This is a port of Snake for the TI-84+ce written in ez80 asm.

## Known issues
For some reason the game board seems to get polluted and can start spawning extra food or kill you. 

## Credits
This is compiled using [fasmg ez80](https://github.com/jacobly0/fasmg-ez80)

Include files taken from [CE-Programing/asm-docs](https://github.com/CE-Programming/asm-docs)

The RNG and division routines are taken from [Zeda](https://github.com/Zeda/Z80-Optimized-Routines) though slightly modified to work on the 84+ce
